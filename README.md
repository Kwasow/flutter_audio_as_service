The plugin is Android only as of now.


# 1. Before you begin

Add this permission to AndroidManifest.xml:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"/>
```

Make sure your app uses Java8 by adding this code into your app-level build.gradle into the android section:
```gradle
compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
}
```

Enable androidx support in your app.

Add the service to AndroidMainfest.xml
```xml
<manifest>
  ...
  <application>
    ...
    ...
    <service 
      android:name="net.tailosive.flutter_audio_as_service.AudioService"/>
  </application>
</manifest>
```

# 2. Usage

To start playback initialize the player with the following:
```dart
AudioInfo info = AudioInfo(
  "Title",
  "Author",
  audioUrl,
  coverUrl,
  drawableAppIcon
)

FlutterAudioAsService.init(info);
```
audioUrl and coverUrl are strings - could be both urls or a file directories (file:///)

How to properly set appIcon
  - put the desired .png image into android/src/main/res/drawable/
  - if your resource is app_icon.png then set the appIcon value to be "app_icon"
  - the value can be null

If you wish you can set event listeners as follows:
```dart
AudioPlayerListener listener = AudioPlayerListener(
  onPlayerStateChanged: (PlayerState playerState) {
    print(playerState);
  },
  onPlayerPositionChanged: (Duration playerPosition) {
    print(playerPosition.toString());
  },
  onPlayerCompleted: () {
    print("Player completed");
  }
);

FlutterAudioAsService.setListeners(listener);
```

Playback is controlled with the following functions:
```dart
FlutterAudioAsService.pause();
FlutterAudioAsService.resume();
```

During playback you may also seek with:
```dart
FlutterAudioAsService.seekBy(Duration(seconds: 30));
FlutterAudioAsService.seekTo(Duration(minutes: 15, seconds: 47));
```

To stop playback and destroy the service run:
```dart
FlutterAudioAsService.stop();
```

# 3. Features

The plugin supports audio playback as an Android service with caching functionality included. It uses ExoPlayer with MediaSession API and rich notification controls.

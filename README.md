## Usage

1. Before you begin
Add this permission to AndridManifest.xml:
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"/>

Make sure your app uses Java8 by adding this code into your app-level build.gradle into the android section:
```compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
```

Enable androidx support in your app.

Add the service to AndroidMainfest.xml
```
<manifest>
  ...
  <application>
    ...
    ...
    <service 
      android:name="net.tailosive.flutter_audio_as_service.AudioService"/>
  </application>
</manifest>
```

2. Usage
To start playback initialize the player with the following:
```
FlutterAudioAsService.init("Title", "Author", audioSource);
```
audioSource is a string - could be both a url or a file directory.

Playback is controlled with the following functions:
```
FlutterAudioAsService.pause();
FlutterAudioAsService.resume();
```

To stop playback and destroy the service run:
```
FlutterAudioAsService.stop();
```

3. Features
The plugin supports audio playback as an Android service with caching functionality included. It uses ExoPlayer with MediaSession API and rich notification controls.
